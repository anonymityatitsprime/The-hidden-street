Noctyx Corp’s internal audit trail references an external document once hosted on a government research domain. The record was cited during oversight reviews, then quietly removed years later.

The link still exists in the logs.
The content does not.

Accessing it today leads nowhere but an error—an absence where information once lived.

The document contained official correspondence and approval notices. Among the signatories, one individual appears multiple times:

Mr. Foster.

The original page no longer responds, but its contents were preserved when the site was still alive.

Recover the document as it existed in the past and determine:

On which street did Mr. Foster live?
(Answer is only a single word will all lowercases.)
